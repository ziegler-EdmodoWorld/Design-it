# Foreword
When I picked up the final draft of this book, at first I was surprised to see that it was missing any mention of Agile software development. Michael and I have been chatting about this book for years now, and I thought I knew what the book was about and why it must be written: software architecture ideas, as traditionally described, have been hard to use in Agile processes, but Michael has figured out how to do just that. So how could “Agile” not be on every page of the book?

*当我最终拿起这本书的终稿时,一开始我吃惊的发现里面居然没有提到任何有关敏捷开发的内容.Michale和我已经就这本书讨论了大概几年了,我认为我很清楚为什么要写这本书以及这本书的主题:软件架构的概念,从传统意义上讲是很难应用到敏捷开发流程中的,但是Michael已经想出了怎么来做到这一点.所以奇怪的是"敏捷"怎么会没出现在这本书的每一页中呢?*

Michael is a modern Prometheus, fascinated by technology and determined to tame it for all of humanity. He is a true believer in the benefits of Agile and an expert in software architecture. I know of no one else who was walking the walk as an Agile team leader during the day while mentoring Carnegie Mellon software architecture students at night. I know him best through our involvement in the SATURN software architecture conference, where he has brought ideas and thought leaders from the Agile community to rub elbows with the architecture community. He has been looking for the best of both worlds, a mixture of Agile and architecture that is not oil and water.

*Michael是现在的普罗米修斯,着迷于技术,一心想要用技术为人类服务.他是敏捷开发的忠实信徒,同时也是一个软件架构专家.我不认识第二个人能同时在白天领导敏捷团队,晚上去卡内基梅隆大学指导学生学习软件架构理论.他最让我印象深刻的就是我们一起参加"土星软件架构大会"的时候他将敏捷社区的观点和核心理念带到了软件架构社区.他一直在尝试就这两件事情完美的融合,敏捷和架构之间不应该是水和油的关系.*

There have been other attempts to reconcile the differences, but they have all been limited. Early attempts tried to shoehorn Agile into the implementation phase of a waterfall process. Others implicitly assumed there was still a “corner office architect” making the important decisions. Almost all of them were based in theory rather than reporting on what they had successfully applied and were written by an author in one camp trying to pull in ideas from the other.

*之前也有其他人试图去调和这两者之间的鸿沟,但是进展都有限.早期的尝试是将敏捷放入一个瀑布模型的开发流程中,其他人仍然假定会有一个"架构师司令部"负责制定决策.几乎所有的尝试都是基于理论而不是真正成功的实践经验,而且很多时候大家会喜欢去照搬别人的经验.*

This book is a different, better synthesis of Agile and architecture, which is why the word “Agile” is not on every page. It starts with a deep understanding and appreciation for Agile values and describes design techniques that are compatible. Michael has invented or adapted many of the techniques himself, but it thrills me to see that he’s also plucked the best ideas from conferences over the past few years, techniques that are not yet in any other book. If you glance at Part III, “The Architect’s Toolbox,” you will not see “Architect chisels stone tablets for the team.” You will see activities that fit within even week-long iterations, encourage team ownership of the design, and promote the design as a first-class concern of the team. It also has pictures of teams actually applying these techniques.

*这本书非常与众不同,更好的融合的敏捷和架构的思想,所以并不是整本书都在谈论"敏捷".本书一开始就体现出了作者对敏捷开发的深入理解和推崇,同时介绍了与之匹配的设计理论.Michael已经创造了很多这种技术方法,但是我很吃惊的是他依然在过去几年一直会在各种会议中汲取其他优秀在书本中看不到的技术思想.在第三章"架构是一个工具箱"中你不会看到类似"架构是团队应该奉行的真理"之类话,而是更契合按周迭代的工程实践;鼓励团队参与设计,然后把这种设计当作最重要的事情.在这章中还会展示不同团队是怎样实践这些理论的.*
