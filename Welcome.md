#Welcome!

Software architecture is the foundation on which awesome software is built. A great architecture alone isn’t enough to guarantee your software will be a smashing success, but the wrong architecture almost guarantees failure. Software architecture is so important that every software developer should know how to design it.

*架构是优秀的软件基础.只有优秀的架构是无法保证开发出成功的软件的,但是错误的架构一定会导致失败.软件架构重要到需要每个开发人员都应该知道怎样做出正确的设计.*

In this book, you’ll learn how to design great software architectures. Just to be clear, this isn’t a lesson in Ivory Tower, high-abstraction software design. You also won’t find any magic bean solutions—frameworks and technologies that magically solve any problem. You will learn how to apply essential design principles and practices, which will make you a stronger programmer, architect, and technical leader.

*在本书中你会学到怎样设计优秀的软件架构.但是需要澄清一下,这不是象牙塔里的教室或者高度抽象的软件设计.这儿也没有万能的魔法能解决你所有的技术问题.你会学到怎样实践必要的设计原则来使自己成为更优秀的程序员,架构师,技术经理.*

Designing great software requires more than mastery of principles and practices. How you go about designing a software system is just as important as the final result. In this book, you’ll learn how to use design thinking and human-centered methods to design software architectures collaboratively with your team. This approach to architecture design helps you forge a stronger connection between the design decisions you make and the humans affected by those decisions. Putting people first allows you to make better design decisions and, as a result, better software.

*设计一个优秀的软件不仅仅是对理论的掌握和实践而已.软件的设计过程和结果一样重要.通过本书你可以学会如何使用设计思维和以人为中心的方法去和团队一起合作创造软件软件.这种面向架构设计的方法能帮助你在设计决策和参与者之间建立更紧密的联系.让大家首先能做出更好的设计然后创造出更好的软件.*

#Who Should Read This Book?

This book is for anyone who has ever stood at a whiteboard and sketched boxes and lines while trying to answer tough questions.
*这本书适合所有有过站在画满设计框图的白板前被逼问的经历的人.*

If you’re completely new to software architecture design, then this book is the perfect introduction. We’ll start with the basics and work our way through the core fundamentals you need to know to be an amazing software architect.
*如果你是一个软件架构设计的新人,那这本书就是完美的入门教程.我们会从基础开始然后以特有的方式带你了解成为一名出色的软件架构师所必需的品质.*

If you’re a programmer who already knows a thing or two about architecture, then this book will help you organize your thoughts. As you read, you may find concepts you intuited on your own but didn’t know the name, or perhaps you’ll find gaps you didn’t know you were missing. After reading this book, you’ll be able to explain why you do what you do, which puts you in a better position to lead others.
*如果你是一个已经对架构略知一二的程序员,那这本书会帮你重新整理思路.比如你会在本书中学到一些已经在你脑中成型但是还不知道名称的概率,或者你可以发现一个你知识的盲区.读完本书后也许你会认识到为什么你会从事这份工作,怎么才能成为一个出色的领路人.*

If you’re already a software architect and this isn’t your first rodeo, then this book will give you a fresh perspective on how to lead your team. The junior programmers of today expect to have a greater say in the software they build. The focus on fundamentals in this book will prepare you to teach and mentor today’s programmers—the architects of tomorrow—so they can fully participate in the design process. The collaborative design approaches described throughout this book will give you new techniques for safely and productively collaborating with less experienced teammates as you design a software system together.
*如果你已经是一名有经验的架构师,那本书会给你一个全新的视角去学习怎样代理你的团队.现在的年轻程序员希望能在项目中有更大的发言权,而本书所聚焦的内容会帮你去教会当下的程序员未来的软件架构,这样他们就可以完全参与到设计过程中来.本书提及的协作设计方法教会你如何与缺乏经验的队友高效而低风险地一起进行软件设计工作.*

#How to Read This Book

This book is divided into three parts. Parts I and II are designed to be read start to finish. Part III is designed for easy reference.
*本书分为三个部分,第一二部份建议从头到尾全部阅读,第三部分包含了本书的引用.*

In Part I you’ll learn the basics of software architecture and design thinking needed to become an architect.
In Part II you’ll learn the essential skills and knowledge all software architects possess.
*在第一部分你会学到软件架构的基础和架构师的思维模式.第二部分学习软架构师所必需的技能和知识.*
Part III includes a set of practical architecture design methods. There are no silver bullets, but every software engineer has a silver toolbox filled with practices, methods, and techniques that together allow them to ship amazing software. The methods in Part III come from my silver toolbox and it is my privilege to share them with you.
*第三部分包含一系列的架构设计方法.虽然没有银弹,但是每个工程师都有装满了自己的经验,方法论以及技术能力的百宝箱,这让他们能创造出优秀的软件.第三部分的的内容就是我自己的百宝箱,很乐意跟大家来分享.*

Each chapter in Parts II and III focuses on a different design mindset, which you’ll learn more about in Chapter 2, ​Design Thinking Fundamentals​. Design mindsets are a way of thinking about the world to help us focus our attention on the right details at the right time. There are four design mindsets: understand, explore, make, and evaluate. Look for the icon at the start of each chapter to tell you which mindset you’ll be learning about next.
*第二部分和第三部分的每一章都聚焦在不同的思维模式上,在第二章‘设计思维基础’中会详细的介绍.思维模式是对整个世界的思考,让我们能在正确的时间专注于正确的事情上.有四种不同的思维模式:理解,探索,实践和演进.每章开头都有一个图标告诉你正在学习的思维模式是什么.*
