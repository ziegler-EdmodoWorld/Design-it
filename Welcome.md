#Welcome!

Software architecture is the foundation on which awesome software is built. A great architecture alone isn’t enough to guarantee your software will be a smashing success, but the wrong architecture almost guarantees failure. Software architecture is so important that every software developer should know how to design it.

*架构是优秀的软件基础.只有优秀的架构是无法保证开发出成功的软件的,但是错误的架构一定会导致失败.软件架构重要到需要每个开发人员都应该知道怎样做出正确的设计.*

In this book, you’ll learn how to design great software architectures. Just to be clear, this isn’t a lesson in Ivory Tower, high-abstraction software design. You also won’t find any magic bean solutions—frameworks and technologies that magically solve any problem. You will learn how to apply essential design principles and practices, which will make you a stronger programmer, architect, and technical leader.

*在本书中你会学到怎样设计优秀的软件架构.但是需要澄清一下,这不是象牙塔里的教室或者高度抽象的软件设计.这儿也没有万能的魔法能解决你所有的技术问题.你会学到怎样实践必要的设计原则来使自己成为更优秀的程序员,架构师,技术经理.*
