#Welcome!

Software architecture is the foundation on which awesome software is built. A great architecture alone isn’t enough to guarantee your software will be a smashing success, but the wrong architecture almost guarantees failure. Software architecture is so important that every software developer should know how to design it.

*架构是优秀的软件基础.只有优秀的架构是无法保证开发出成功的软件的,但是错误的架构一定会导致失败.软件架构重要到需要每个开发人员都应该知道怎样做出正确的设计.*

In this book, you’ll learn how to design great software architectures. Just to be clear, this isn’t a lesson in Ivory Tower, high-abstraction software design. You also won’t find any magic bean solutions—frameworks and technologies that magically solve any problem. You will learn how to apply essential design principles and practices, which will make you a stronger programmer, architect, and technical leader.

*在本书中你会学到怎样设计优秀的软件架构.但是需要澄清一下,这不是象牙塔里的教室或者高度抽象的软件设计.这儿也没有万能的魔法能解决你所有的技术问题.你会学到怎样实践必要的设计原则来使自己成为更优秀的程序员,架构师,技术经理.*

Designing great software requires more than mastery of principles and practices. How you go about designing a software system is just as important as the final result. In this book, you’ll learn how to use design thinking and human-centered methods to design software architectures collaboratively with your team. This approach to architecture design helps you forge a stronger connection between the design decisions you make and the humans affected by those decisions. Putting people first allows you to make better design decisions and, as a result, better software.

*设计一个优秀的软件不仅仅是对理论的掌握和实践而已.软件的设计过程和结果一样重要.通过本书你可以学会如何使用设计思维和以人为中心的方法去和团队一起合作创造软件软件.这种面向架构设计的方法能帮助你在设计决策和参与者之间建立更紧密的联系.让大家首先能做出更好的设计然后创造出更好的软件.*
