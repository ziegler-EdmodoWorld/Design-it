## Design Thinking Fundamentals

On your first day working with any software system the architecture is always TBD—to be discovered. Whether we start from a blank page or must uncover structures in an existing software system, the architecture we need is out there, somewhere, waiting for us to discover it. To design a software system’s architecture we explore solutions at the same time we’re working to uncover the problem to be solved.

*从你第一天开发某个软件系统开始系统架构就是一直需要去学习的内容.不管我们是从零开始开发新系统还是需要去发现某个现存系统的结构,软件架构始终就在那儿等待着我们去发现它.我们总是在开发过程中一边解决遇到的问题一边设计软件架构.*

To help you perform this challenging task, you’ll learn a creative and analytical approach to problem solving that puts humans at the center of attention called design thinking. Focusing on the people affected by your design decisions helps you concentrate on the exact problems that must be solved. It also grounds your solution exploration by reminding you that your purpose is to build software that helps people.

*为了帮助你完成这项有挑战的任务,你需要学习一项有新意且基于分析的方法来解决问题,同时这种方法是把注意力都放在了用户身上,这种方法叫做设计思维.聚焦在用户身上的这种设计理念能帮助你把注意放在解决最紧急的问题上.同时也根据方案落地的效果来提醒你,软件最终是用来帮助用户的.*

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to apply design thinking to software architecture. You’ll start by learning the core principles of design thinking. Next, you’ll learn how to use different design mindsets to keep your architecture moving forward in (mostly) the right direction. Finally, you’ll see an approach for picking design mindsets.

*在本章中,你会学到怎样应用设计思维来思考软件架构.你会从学习几个核心的设计原则开始,然后学习怎样使用不同的设计思路来让你的架构尽量保持在正确的方向上演进.最后你会看到能帮助你选择设计思路的方法.*
