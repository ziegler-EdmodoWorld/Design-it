## Design Thinking Fundamentals

On your first day working with any software system the architecture is always TBD—to be discovered. Whether we start from a blank page or must uncover structures in an existing software system, the architecture we need is out there, somewhere, waiting for us to discover it. To design a software system’s architecture we explore solutions at the same time we’re working to uncover the problem to be solved.

*从你第一天开发某个软件系统开始系统架构就是一直需要去学习的内容.不管我们是从零开始开发新系统还是需要去发现某个现存系统的结构,软件架构始终就在那儿等待着我们去发现它.我们总是在开发过程中一边解决遇到的问题一边设计软件架构.*

To help you perform this challenging task, you’ll learn a creative and analytical approach to problem solving that puts humans at the center of attention called design thinking. Focusing on the people affected by your design decisions helps you concentrate on the exact problems that must be solved. It also grounds your solution exploration by reminding you that your purpose is to build software that helps people.

*为了帮助你完成这项有挑战的任务,你需要学习一项有新意且基于分析的方法来解决问题,同时这种方法是把注意力都放在了用户身上,这种方法叫做设计思维.聚焦在用户身上的这种设计理念能帮助你把注意放在解决最紧急的问题上.同时也根据方案落地的效果来提醒你,软件最终是用来帮助用户的.*

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to apply design thinking to software architecture. You’ll start by learning the core principles of design thinking. Next, you’ll learn how to use different design mindsets to keep your architecture moving forward in (mostly) the right direction. Finally, you’ll see an approach for picking design mindsets.

*在本章中,你会学到怎样应用设计思维来思考软件架构.你会从学习几个核心的设计原则开始,然后学习怎样使用不同的设计思路来让你的架构尽量保持在正确的方向上演进.最后你会看到能帮助你选择设计思路的方法.*

### The Four Principles of Design Thinking

Design thinking is less a process and more a way of thinking about problems and solutions from the perspective of the people affected by them. While design thinking is not a process, there are still rules to guide our design activities. In Design Thinking: Understand - Improve - Apply Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer propose four universal principles of design. These principles apply to software architecture as well as to detailed program design, user interaction design, or any other design-focused discipline.

*设计思维更多的是从受众的角度出发来思考问题和解决方案而不仅仅是一种流程.虽然设计思维不是一种流程,但是依然有指引我们的设计工作的规则,那就是理解 - 优化 - 实施, Christoph Meinel和Larry Leifer提出了四个统一的设计原则,这些原则同时适用于软件架构和具体的编程设计和用户交互设计,或者其他任何以设计为主的过程.*

Here are the four principles of design:

*下面就是这四个设计原则:*

1. Human rule.
All design is social in nature.

*1. 以人为本
所有的设计都是自然界中的社交行为*

2. Ambiguity rule.
Preserve ambiguity.

*2.歧义规则
避免歧义*

3. Redesign rule.
All design is redesign.

*3.再设计规则
所有的设计都是再设计*

4. Tangibility rule.
Make ideas tangible to facilitate communication.

*4.有形性规则
将想法转化为可见的实体更有助于交流*

We’ll use the acronym HART to help remember these principles. Let’s examine the HART principles as they relate to software architecture design so we can see how to apply design thinking in the context of software architecture.

*我们会使用HART的缩写来帮助记忆这些原则,我们先在软件架构领域来检验HART原则,进一步来看怎样使用设计思维来进行软件架构设计.*

### Design for Humans

Design is an inherently human-focused endeavor. We design software for people. We design software with people. Every design decision in the architecture helps individuals in some way. Every design decision must be understood by and shared with other humans.

*设计是一种天生的为人服务的工作.我们为别人设计软件,同时我们和别人一起完成软件设计.软件架构中的每一个设计决策都帮助在某个方面帮助着每个人,每个设计决策都应该是易懂且易于被分享给别人理解的.*

Architects must empathize with all stakeholders. We care about end users as much as the people the end users help, the programmers who write the code, the testers who verify it, and even the managers who keep tabs on the development schedule. As we design a software system, we’ll collaborate with the other humans on our team and show them respect by listening, assuming positive intent, and using human-centered design methods.

*架构师必须考虑到所有参与者的感受,我们不仅关心软件用户同样也关心我们的用户的用户,程序员写代码,测试人员验证软件功能,甚至项目经理管理开放周期都是在做这件事.在设计软件系统的过程中我们和其他团队成员通过倾听对方,积极看待对方的想法以及本真以人为本的设计方法来充分合作.*
